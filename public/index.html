      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h1>QUESTION ANSWER</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align:left;">1. How React Work?</h2>
    <p style="text-align:left;">ANSWER: <br>We know that HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT are used to create a website. The browser
      creates a render tree behind
      the scenes so that the user can interact with the DOM.
      React always drives one-way data flow. Creating a connection between child and parent components when designing an
      app.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:left;">2. How Does useState work?</h2>
    <p style="text-align:left;">ANSWER: <br> Use State returns a pair of values that are in an Array. It will pass an
      initial state of a function. It returns a variable with the present state.UseState is used to modify the user on
      the website.When useState is used for an ARRAY, the empty array has to be set as its initial value.
